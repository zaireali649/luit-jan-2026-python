# luit-jan-2026-python

This repository contains introductory Python examples used for learning **Python fundamentals**, with a focus on **imports**, basic standard libraries, and simple output.

## Contents

The repository currently includes very basic Python scripts demonstrating:

### 1. Printing Output
A simple example showing how to print text to the console:

```python
print("Hello World")  # Prints the text "Hello World" to the console
```

### 2. Using Imports
An introductory script that demonstrates how to import and use common Python libraries:

- `random` for generating random numbers  
- `math` for basic mathematical operations  
- `os` for interacting with the operating system  
- `sys` for accessing Python runtime information  
- `matplotlib` for basic data visualization  

The script shows:
- Generating a random number
- Performing math operations like square roots and factorials
- Reading the current working directory and listing files
- Printing Python version and command-line arguments
- Creating and displaying a simple plot

## Purpose

This repository is intended for **beginner-level Python learners** to:

- Understand what `import` statements are and why they are used
- See how different libraries serve different purposes
- Practice reading and running simple Python scripts
- Get early exposure to plotting with `matplotlib`

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib` installed (for the plotting example)

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## Notes

- All examples are intentionally simple and beginner-friendly
- No advanced Python concepts are used
- The repository only reflects examples covered so far in instruction
